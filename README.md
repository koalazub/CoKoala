I'm turning my portfolio into an experimental guinea pig by practising Angular 7 on it. So far... it looks horribly designed. But whatever - it works! I've been working on front-end dev work as it seems quite apparent that developers need to know EVERYTHING in order to secure a job. That being said - it's so much fun! It's a lot easier to fiddle with things and experiment with new techniques that you're able to see almost immediately. I do tend to go for fancier techniques as I'm of the impression that it looks cool so long as it's not being esoteric in an egotistical manner.

Anyway, if you're in the mood to learn Angular 7 and need a template, feel free to download this hunk of portfolio goodness and fiddle away. Just as an FYI - this is my first attempt with Ang7 so don't be too harsh on the way I've structured everything, I'm trying to learn here!
