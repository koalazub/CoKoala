      When designing games – it’s good practice (not to mention ethical) to consider all demographics who might be
      playing your game. For some time – I’ve not been impressed with the inclusion of the differently-abled. I enjoy
      coding shaders and graphics and wanted to demonstrate something practical and useful in game development that can
      be crossed over to apps and visual systems. This project addresses people with colour weaknesses. Namely
      deuteranopia, protanopia and tritanopia. The first two are dichromatic weaknesses with tritanopia being a
      blue-yellow weakness. I would like to state that it’s not so simply defined, but for this demonstration, it should
      be enough to elucidate the overall goal I - loosely – achieved. This was done via the game engine UE4 utilising
      both C++ and Blueprints (a UE4 visual scripting tool for C++). Unfortunately, the game designer I was working with
      was unable to continue, and so this demonstration remains just that, a demonstration.

    <p><strong>Dish Pig Dilemma<br></strong>

      This was a game demo that failed but brought with it a wonderful amount of experience and lessons learned. This
      was the first time I’d collaborated with a team of 5+ people. The plans were still in the early stages, but we
      were eager to get started. This was the first time I appreciated Git and realised the reason for why it was such a
      highly desired skill. Git can be a massive timesaver if used properly. We didn’t. Because none of us had used it
      before – we had to go through the ordeal of learning GitHub via CMD due to the GUI being so unresponsive at the
      time (They’ve improved it since, but I now have a sceptical level of trust with it. At the time I was still
      getting acquainted with UE4’s Blueprint system. The mechanics and systems were slowly being implemented in a more
      stable way, with information stored in their appropriate states that were observable when required. The next stage
      was to do with kinematics. The designers requested the ability to manipulate the skeleton of the model freely.
      This was a lot #more difficult to execute than originally anticipated due to the way the skeleton was connected to
      the model itself. After several weeks of learning about skeletons, kinematics and the like, we settled on just
      having the ability to mode the limbs of the protagonist without gravity. I added inverse kinematics to give the
      illusion of swaying along with controls doing the opposite of what traditional game mechanics and controllers were
      to do. It was pretty much switching the controls i.e. left joystick is for the right hand and moves the hand to
      the left. Proper discombobulation. The designers were unable to progress any further with what they had planned
      due to constraints with the system. I was unable to learn all that I could regarding skeleton manipulation as I
      was caught up trying to optimise the mechanics and systems to the point of usability and our lead designer had his
      hands full with documentation, model design and assisting me (as well as learning) Git, UE4 kinematics and the
      like. Suffice to say, the deadline quickly approached, and we were only able to show off the unstable document.
      After that project, we all learned a valuable lesson. Do the bloody research.

    <p class="section"><strong>Flipping Time!<br></strong>
      I really enjoyed working on this game mechanic demonstration. Using lists in C# and .NET, I was able to to store
      key variables and recall them in reverse order. I used a method that would record transform positions, quaternions
      and [one other thing here]. I then created two other methods – one is called per frame so long as the player held
      the backspace key down and another that would ‘rewind’ the player by calling the function that was loop through
      the variable from the last state that the recording method stored last and work its way backward. I optimised the
      recording system by flushing out the rewind capabilities according to the maximum amount of time the player can
      rewind.
      This demo is part of a 2D platform game called Flipping Time! It gives the player the opportunity to complete the
      level should they fall over by rewinding themselves back to the point of fault. There is a bar that fills and is
      proportional to the amount of time they’re able to rewind.

    <p><strong>Merrikh's Bolide</strong>

      Merrikh’s Bolide is a 3D space shooter rail game. The aim of the game is to complete each level by reaching the
      end. The player must break through, shoot or tunnel through layers of meteors in order to get to the end. This
      game had a team of 5 people with me as the project manager. We demonstrated the working of a fully playable demo.
      The experiences learned from this game were valuable beyond the scope of this project. I learned to manage time
      efficiently, liaise with individuals and teams of differing skillsets and learned to communicate effectively.
      These skillsets I’ve found to be as equal, if not more important than just programming by itself.

      <strong>My Portfolio</strong>
      Frontend development is fun! You plug your IDE to a browser and from there you’re able to view immediately what
      you’re doing to a webpage, website, app or whatever the kids like to call it these days. I wanted to use
      a language/framework that is prominent in the industry currently, but I didn't want to go cowboy and use a
      framework that
      is
      still in its infancy. So, I chose AngularJS to be my dance partner. I learned about nodes, packages, yarn,
      chocolatey and all the terminal/cmd keywords required to get my portfolio established and viewable. The syntax was
      interesting to learn, as it’s quite messy for my liking (I come from a C++/C# background). I learned about
      navigating and routing pages using components and loading content through imports. On top of all these skills
      acquired, I also learned to upload content to my domain using virtual machines via SSH and SFTP. Learning the
      methods by which we manage servers, domains and files was illuminating, to say the least. I’m currently looking at
      styling my page and have been wanting to expand upon my current knowledge of CSS/HTML (probably should’ve
      mentioned that I learned these during this project as well!) in a more dynamic fashion. With the skills
      requirements of developers expanding the way it is, I’m very happy that I took the time to learn frontend
      development.
